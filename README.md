<li>September 24, The CDC defines a case of AIDS as a disease, at least moderately predictive of a defect in cell-mediated immunity, occurring in a person with no known cause for diminished resistance to that disease. Such diseases include KS, PCP, and serious OI. Diagnoses are considered to fit the case definition only if based on sufficiently reliable methods (generally histology or culture). Some patients who are considered AIDS cases on the basis of diseases only moderately predictive of cellular immunodeficiency may not actually be immunodeficient and may not be part of the current epidemic.</li>

<li>New, aggressive strain of HIV discovered in Cuba&nbsp;Researchers at the University of Leuven in Belgium say the HIV strain CRF19 can progress to AIDS within two to three years of exposure to virus. Typically, HIV takes approximately 10 years to develop into AIDS. The researchers found that patients with the CRF19 variant had more virus in their blood than patients who had more common strains. Patients with CRF19 may start getting sick before they even know they've been infected, which ultimately means there's a significantly shorter time span to stop the disease's progression. The researchers suspect that fragments of other subsets of the virus fasten to each other through an enzyme which makes the virus more powerful and more easily replicated in the body, thus the faster progression.</li>

<li>Researchers have found that an international study found that almost 2,000 patients with HIV failed to respond to the antiviral drug known as&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Tenofovir" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenofovir">Tenofovir disoproxil</a>. Tenofovir is the main HIV drug treatment.

<li>The United Nations holds its 2016 High-Level Meeting on Ending AIDS. The countries involved, the member states of the United Nations, pledge to end the AIDS epidemic by 2030. There was significant controversy surrounding the event as over 50 countries blocked the access of LGBTQ+ groups from participating in the meeting. At the conclusion of the meetings, which ran from June 8&ndash;10, 2016, the final resolution barely mentioned several groups that are most affected by HIV/AIDS, men who have sex with men, transgender people, people who inject drugs, and sex workers.</li>
